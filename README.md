##  Getting Started - Diving into Ethereal Notes

To get Ethereal Notes up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the Repository**: Obtain the project source code from the GitHub repository. Replace `[https://github.com/your-org/ethereal-notes.git](https://github.com/your-org/ethereal-notes.git)` with the actual repository URL.

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-org/ethereal-notes.git](https://github.com/your-org/ethereal-notes.git)
    cd ethereal-notes
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies**: Navigate into the project directory and install the necessary packages. You can use either `pnpm`, `yarn`, or `npm`.

    ```bash
    pnpm install  # Recommended if you have it
    # or
    yarn install
    # or
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables**: Ethereal Notes relies on several environment variables to connect to external services like Clerk, Convex, and EdgeStore. You will need to create a `.env.local` file in the root of your project and populate it with the required keys and URLs. Here are the essential variables you'll need to configure:

    ```
    CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret_key
    CLERK_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your_clerk_publishable_key
    CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT_URL=your_convex_deployment_url
    EDGE_STORE_API_KEY=your_edgestore_api_key
    EDGE_STORE_URL=your_edgestore_url
    # Add any other necessary environment variables here
    ```

    Refer to the documentation of Clerk, Convex, and EdgeStore for instructions on how to obtain these credentials.

4.  **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed and the environment variables are configured, you can start the Next.js development server.

    ```bash
    pnpm dev      # Runs the application on http://localhost:3000 by default
    # or
    yarn dev
    # or
    npm run dev
    ```

    Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to see Ethereal Notes in action.

##  Architecture - How Ethereal Notes is Organized

Ethereal Notes follows a well-structured architecture to ensure maintainability, scalability, and a clear separation of concerns:

* **`app/` (Next.js App Router)**: This directory houses the main application routes, layouts, and page components, leveraging the latest features of Next.js for efficient routing and data fetching.
* **`components/editor/`**: Contains the modular React components that make up the Blocknote-powered editor. These components are designed to be reusable and extendable, allowing for future enhancements to the editing experience.
* **`state/`**: Manages the application's client-side state using Zustand. This centralizes state management, making it easier to track and update data across different components.
* **`convex/`**: This directory holds all the Convex backend functions, including queries for fetching data, mutations for updating data, and any server-side logic that powers the real-time features and data persistence of the application.
* **`lib/edgestore.ts` (or similar)**: Contains the integration logic for interacting with EdgeStore, including hooks and utilities for handling file uploads and retrieval.
* **`components/ui/`**: Houses the reusable UI components built with ShadCN UI and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a consistent and aesthetically pleasing design throughout the application.
* **`styles/`**: Contains global CSS files and Tailwind CSS configuration.
* **`public/`**: Serves as the directory for static assets such as images, fonts, and other publicly accessible files.

## üîß Development Tools & Practices

Ethereal Notes embraces modern development practices and utilizes the following tools to ensure code quality and consistency:

* **Linting (ESLint with Next.js config)**: Enforces code style and identifies potential issues early in the development process, adhering to best practices and the recommended Next.js configuration.
* **Type Checking (TypeScript)**: Provides static typing, improving code maintainability and reducing runtime errors by catching type-related issues during development.
* **Formatting (Prettier - Optional Configuration)**: Automatically formats code to maintain a consistent style across the codebase. While configuration might be optional, its use is highly recommended for collaborative projects.
